#  Zazacito X EntalpiAs App

Welcome to my node JS App!
You can import and visualise running datasets!

VISUALIZE YOUR DATASET tab: select the dataset you want to visualize.
COMPARE TWO DATASET tab: still in progress.
RAW DATA tab: visualize the raw and meta data from the datasets already imported. And also add your own dataset.

⚠️ In the case that the dataset imported contain anomalies, (missing rows, NaN's, weird latitude and longitude or missing periods), a back end algorithm will try and predict the correct values based on a quick linear regression.

⚠️ In the case that the dataset imported contain data after the end of your race, another backend algorithm will try and find the proper end.
